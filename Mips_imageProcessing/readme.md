## About The Project

[Computer Architecture Assignment](https://vula.uct.ac.za/access/content/attachment/e48d2390-2c06-46d6-8af5-fd3feae81ce8/Assignments/d99a5897-c6a1-4bb3-951e-f3f6f26f40a5/csc2002s_arch_assign_brief.pdf)

This application was built for the purpose of submission to the University of Cape Town as part of the ciriculum. 
<br>

>**The aim of this project is to learn how to manage data in dynamic ways using assembly through processing ppm images. This is achieved by performing calculations on the pixels from the image files to create a brightened version and a greyscale version respectively** 


### Built With

* Mips Assembly


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites and Installation

A simulator is necessary to run the assembly language programs. QTSpim is reccomended and is what was used to test the programs
* Installing QTSpim
  - Navigate to [Source Forge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/), click download, and choose the prefered version of QT Spim for your machine

  - Follow installation prompts
* GIMP 
  - Gimp is required to view the ppm images on machines running windows and linux. MacOS users need not download GIMP and can view the images in the Preview app built into the OS. 

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

1. Example images have been provided for running the program with. Should you want to use your own ppm files, place them in the sample_images folder
2. The application is run from QTSpim
2. And can only
**Usage examples**: To act as a basis for a game environment



<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- *Start button*: used  to begin the flow of the numbered patrons into the club. 
- *Pause button*: Used to control the liveness of the 
- *Quit button*: Used to terminate the application
- *Waiting Tally*: Used to indicate how many clubgoers are waiting to be admitted into the club grid at any given time. This number should change often.
- *The grid*: A fixed number of blocks with a scaled region for dance floor and bar area
- *Patrons*: Numbered dots act as the clubgoers which move around to simulate human behaviour.
